# timeline

**Show the chronological timeline of events on a PR (reviews, comments, labels, CI, etc.).**

The `timeline` command displays a chronological history of all events on a PR — who requested reviews, when reviews were submitted, comments added, labels changed, branch updates, and more. It's like a "git log" for the PR's lifecycle.

## When to Use

- Understand the full history of a PR before diving into review
- See when and why review requests were made
- Track down who made specific comments or requested changes
- Identify bottlenecks in the PR review process
- See if a PR has been sitting idle or has active discussion

## Synopsis

```bash
review-dispatcher timeline [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `PR_NUMBER` | Target a specific PR by number | Interactive selection |
| `--pr, -p` | Target a specific PR by number (global) | Interactive selection |
| `--pr-numbers` | Show timeline for multiple PRs (comma-separated) | Single PR |
| `--all, -a` | Show timeline for all pending reviews (no interactive selection) | `false` |
| `--dry-run, -n` | Preview which PRs would be shown without displaying timelines | `false` |
| `--json` | Output as JSON for scripting | `false` |
| `--repo` | Filter by repository name (partial match, case-insensitive) | All repos |
| `--author` | Filter by author username (partial match, case-insensitive) | All authors |
| `-P, --priority` | Show priority score for each PR (1-5 stars based on age and size) | `false` |
| `-s, --since-days <DAYS>` | Only show PRs created since this many days ago | All ages |

## Examples

```bash
# Show timeline for a specific PR
review-dispatcher timeline --pr 4821

# Show timelines for multiple PRs at once (fetched in parallel)
review-dispatcher timeline --pr-numbers 4821,4822,4823

  "pr_title": "feat: add CSV export",
  "repo": "myorg/frontend",
  "url": "https://github.com/myorg/frontend/pull/4821",
  "priority_score": 4,
  "events": [
    {
      "event": "PullRequestReview",
      "created_at": "2026-03-19T09:00:00Z",
      "actor": "reviewer1",
      "data": {
        "review_state": "APPROVED",
        "body_preview": "LGTM now"
      }

}
```

## Tips

- Use `--json` for integration with scripts, dashboards, or custom tooling
- Timeline shows events chronologically (oldest first)
- Summary shows counts of reviews, comments, and label changes
- Great for understanding why a PR has been sitting — check the timeline to see if it's actively being worked on or abandoned
